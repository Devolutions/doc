A ***zero standing privileges*** (ZSP) account in Devolutions PAM is an account that possesses no permissions and is a member of no groups. If compromised, it should be impossible for the attacker to achieve anything. This significantly reduces exposure, as the account is only used for a small fraction of the total hours in a year. At Devolutions, privileged accounts (PAs) are typically reserved for a few hours per week, further minimizing risk.
