## A note on Credentials

Credentials in the {{ en.UVLT }} can be used in two ways:

1. From a session using the ***{{ en.UVLT }} search***.
1. When using the ***User Specific Settings*** feature.

These restrictions can easily be understood when you keep in mind that the {{ en.UVLT }} is in fact contained in the user area of the database. It must be used from within the {{ en.UVLT }}, or by using our extension mechanism that is user specific.
