***Advanced Data Sources*** are highly configurable data sources, typically running on an advanced management system, such as a database management system or our own online services.  

They greatly increase the set of managing features available to administrators, such as:  

* Document uploads and entry attachments. 
* Auditing and logging. 
* Advanced security with [User management](/rdm/windows/commands/administration/management/user-management/). 
* [Offline mode](/rdm/windows/data-sources/offline-mode/). 
* [2-Factor Authentication](/rdm/windows/data-sources/multi-factor-authentication/). 

Currently, the ***Advanced Data Sources*** are: 

* [{{ en.DHUBB }}](/rdm/windows/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/hub-business/). 
* [{{ en.DVLS }}](/rdm/windows/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/server/).
