{{ en.RDM }} 's SQLite data source is ideal for single user and stand-alone situations. More powerful and more flexible than the XML file format, it also supports a few of the Advanced Data Source options like Logs and Attachments.

## Highlights

* Full connection log and attachments support.
* The [{{ en.OBACK }} Service](/cloud/rdm-online-services/online-backup/) is available for this data source.

{% snippet icon.shieldInfo %}
All passwords are encrypted by default by {{ en.RDM }}. You can specify a custom password to fully encrypt the content of the SQLite database.
{% endsnippet %}

{% snippet icon.shieldWarning %}
Password recovery is not possible, the data will be unrecoverable if you cannot authenticate. Please ensure you backup the password in a safe place.
{% endsnippet %}

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %}
SQLite supports an unlimited number of simultaneous readers, but will only allow one writer at any instant in time. For this reason {{ en.RDM }} does not support sharing a SQLite data source between several users by storing it on a network drive. If you want to share your data and work in a team environment with your colleagues, please use one of the [Advanced Data Sources](/rdm/windows/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/). Please consult [SQLite.org](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html) for more information.

## Password management

You can specify a password to further encrypt your data. Specify it at creation time. If the data source already exists you can modify the password by using the File â€“ Manage Password dialog.

Change or clear the password of a SQLite data source.
