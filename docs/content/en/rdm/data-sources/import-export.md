  title: Import and export a data source
---
To simplify deployment for multiple users, it is possible to export and import data source configurations. The generated .rdd file contains all the information to recreate the configuration.

{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %}
The .rdd file does not include the database content. Only the configuration is exported. Use the entry's export functionality to back up or copy the content of the database.
{% endsnippet %}

Use ***File â€“ Data Sources*** to access the import or export functionality.

{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %}
Whether or not users can ***Read/Write*** in [Offline mode](/rdm/windows/data-sources/offline-mode/) is first decided at the data source's [Caching mode](/rdm/windows/data-sources/offline-mode/offline-read-write/) level. This cannot be changed remotely. If you wish to prevent or allow remote users the ***Read/Write*** offline feature, you should do so before exporting your data source.
{% endsnippet %}

{% snippet icon.shieldWarning %}
A locked data source can be exported and imported, but the content will be locked unless a password is entered when the data source is selected. See [Lock Data Source](/rdm/windows/data-sources/lock/) for more information.
