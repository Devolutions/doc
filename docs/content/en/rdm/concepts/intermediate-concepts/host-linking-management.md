Core to {{ en.RDM }} is entry reusability. Define a single host to launch multiple connection types such as RDP, SSH, or PowerShell. Create [templates](/rdm/windows/concepts/intermediate-concepts/templates/) to save time on common connection scenarios. [Link credentials](/rdm/windows/commands/edit/entries/entry-credentials-options/) to hosts and avoid hardcoding usernames and passwords to ease password rotations.
