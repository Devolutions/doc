***Remote management*** is the ability to control and monitor computer systems or devices from a distant location. It allows users to access and manage remote machines without having to be physically present at the device location.

It is an integral feature of {{ en.RDM }}. Many dashboard entries are available, including Active Directory, VMware, and Hyper-V. Useful remote tools such as the Remote Task Manager, Remote Printer, and Remote Registry are also supported.
