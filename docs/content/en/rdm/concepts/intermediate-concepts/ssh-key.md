An ***SSH key*** is a secure method of authentication used in the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol to connect to and authenticate with remote servers. It serves as an alternative to password-based logins and consists of a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key, which is shared with SSH servers, and a private key, which remains confidential to the user.

SSH keys can be managed with ***SSH Key agent manager*** in {{ en.RDM}}, allowing you to store all your SSH keys in memory, already decoded and ready to use, thus facilitating seamless authentication.
