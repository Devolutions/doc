***Inheritance*** means that certain properties or attributes of a higher-level entry are automatically passed down to lower-level entries that inherit from it. This can be useful to set default attributes or even simplify management by only having to make changes at the inherited-level entry, thus saving time. Several pieces of information can be inherited, such as credentials, [VPN](/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/vpn-tunnel-gateway-proxy/) configurations, and certain descriptive fields via child-level [variables](/rdm/windows/concepts/intermediate-concepts/variables/). ***Inheritance*** is also preserved between elements in [synchronizers](/rdm/windows/concepts/advanced-concepts/synchronizers/).
