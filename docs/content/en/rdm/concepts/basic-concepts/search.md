***Search*** helps users quickly find what they need, like entries and documents. With the ***Advanced Search***, apply multiple filter conditions and export the results in various formats. Customize your search to limit to the current [{{ en.VLT }}](/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/vaults/), {{ en.UVLT }}, or all {{ en.VLT }}s using the ***Multi {{ en.VLT }} search*** functionality.
