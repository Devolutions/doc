Centralize contact information in {{ en.RDM }}. Once created, reuse an [information](/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/information/) entry elsewhere through linking. Associate contacts to teams, [hosts](/rdm/windows/concepts/intermediate-concepts/host-linking-management/), and entries with [asset](/rdm/windows/concepts/intermediate-concepts/it-asset/) tracking.
