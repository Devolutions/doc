Combine an external privileged access management (PAM) integration with {{ en.RDM }} to help secure, control, manage, and monitor privileged access to critical assets. Streamline injecting credentials into remote sessions from an external PAM solution, eliminating the need to store them in {{ en.RDM }}.
[Devolutions Server with the PAM module](/pam/server/) works hand-in-hand with RDM for an easy-to-use and powerful PAM solution.
