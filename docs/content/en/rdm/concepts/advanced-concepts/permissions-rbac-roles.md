Permissions allow granular control over who can view, modify, or delete data or perform functions within {{ en.RDM }}. ***Role-based access control (RBAC)*** simplifies this process by grouping users into pre-defined roles, each with associated permissions. Assign permissions to objects such as the root of the [{{ en.VLT }}](/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/vaults/), [folders](/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/folders/), or individual entries. Permissions can also be applied at the system level and to a PAM vault.
