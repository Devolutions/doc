You must create a team folder on a server drive to store your default settings templates to share them with your team.

1. Access your server drive (such as \\\servercommon) and create a new team folder to hold all your team default settings templates.

1. In {{ en.RDM }}, go to ***File – Options – Paths***.
1. In ***Default templates***, enter the path to your newly created folder stored on your server drive. All your default templates will then automatically be stored in this folder.

1. If you have remote workers, make sure they can access the shared server in offline mode. Map your network drive, then follow [these instructions](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-10-sync-center) for offline mode access on Windows 10/11.
