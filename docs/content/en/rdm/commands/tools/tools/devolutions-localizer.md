   | Column{width=150}         | Description                                                                               |
   | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Status         | Can be set to different values depending on the translation progress:<br><br><ul><li>***Changed***: The text in its original language has been modified by Devolutions. A local translator must review the localized translation and make changes if necessary.</li><li>***New***: The text has not yet been translated in the target language.</li><li>***Translated***: The text has already been translated in the target language. Any translation marked as ***Translated*** is automatically set to ***Changed*** when we change the English text so that you can reevaluate the translation.</li><li>***Under review***: This status is intended to help translators communicate with each other when they are unsure of the translation and/or use of a particular value.Through the ***Comment*** field, translators can also write translation notes.</li><li>***Use original***: The text should not be translated, it should be kept in its original language. For example, this can apply to product names or third-party system names. Any translation marked as ***Use original*** is automatically set to ***Changed*** when we change the English text so that you can reevaluate the translation.</li></ul>|

   ![Content to Translate or Translated](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/en/rdm/windows/RDMWin2229.png)
1. To start, select a ***Resource*** line in the bottom list and click ***Translate***. The original text will appear in the ***Original*** box.
![Resource Line Selection](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/en/rdm/windows/RDMWin2133.png)

   {% snippet icon.badgeCaution %}
   When translating text, you may encounter the ampersand character ("&") used in a way other than its usual meaning of "and". This is not an error: the ampersand causes the character immediately to the right of it to be underlined when displayed. Please double check before translating.

   For example, "P&roperties" will be displayed as "P r operties" with an underlined "r".
   {% endsnippet %}

1. Type the translated text in the right box.
   {% snippet icon.badgeInfo %}
   A ***Bing*** button is available to assist you in translating your text. The Bing API limits the number of calls per hour. If it fails, try again in an hour or so.
   {% endsnippet %}
