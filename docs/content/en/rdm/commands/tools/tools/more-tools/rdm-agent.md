The ***{{ en.RDMA }}*** is a very powerful tool that allows commands to be run on multiple machines.  
![More Tools – {{ en.RDMA }}](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/rdm/windows/clip11234.png) 

## Settings 

To launch a script through the ***{{ en.RDMA }}***, you first need to open an RDP connection to all the machines you wish to execute the script on. Once opened, select all the opened sessions in the ***[{{ en.NPANE }}]***(/rdm/windows/user-interface/navigation-pane/), right-click them and select Execute Script via Agent.  

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
Execute script via Agent only needs the {{ en.RDMA }} when the script is executed from the Quick Script tab. {{ en.RDM }} needs to be fully installed on the remote computer when the script is executed from the Scripts/Tools tab.
