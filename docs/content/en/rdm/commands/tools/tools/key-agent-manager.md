The ***SSH Key Agent Manager*** is used to hold all your SSH Keys in memory, already decoded and ready for them to be used. It has the same use as Pageant (SSH Key Manager) has for Putty except that the ***SSH Key Agent Manager*** is used with {{ en.RDM }}. 

The ***SSH Key Manager (local)*** is located under ***Tools*** in the ribbon of {{ en.RDM }}.
