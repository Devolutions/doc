### Using a Play List 

First, open your Play List Management in ***Edit – Play List – Play List Management***.  

There are five methods of using your Play List.

| Open                    | Launch the selected Play List.                                             |
| Open Embedded           | Overrides the display selection of entries inside the Play Lists and launches them as Embedded (some entries might not support this).                                                                                                 |
| Select in ***{{ en.NPANE }}*** | Selects all entries the Play List contains in the ***{{ en.NPANE }}***.                                                                                                   |
| Execute Script Against... | This will prompt for you to select the ***Typing Macro*** (exclusively) you wish to execute against your Play list.                                                                                                  |
| Launch at startup         | Here you can select a specific Play List you would like launched whenever the application starts. You can also default back to ***None*** or ***Last opened Connections***.                                                                                 |
