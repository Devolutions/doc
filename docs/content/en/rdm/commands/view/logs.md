### Local Connection Logs

In the ***Logs*** section, you will find the ***Local Connection Logs*** feature, which is useful if you still want to access your local logs. Clicking on it opens a window containing all your local logs in chronological order (oldest to newest). You can scroll through the list to find the logs you are looking for.

The buttons at the bottom of the window give you more options.
