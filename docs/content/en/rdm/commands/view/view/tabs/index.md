### Tab Groups

The ***Tab Groups*** feature opens a docked window showing a tree view of the various tab groups. It is possible to select multiple tabs at once by <kbd>Shift</kbd>-clicking or all of them with the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> shortcut. Right-clicking on one or more tabs shows more options.

The other ***Tab groups*** will only appear if a session that is part of a tab group (other than the ***All*** tab) is active.

Although it is docked by default, the ***Tab Groups*** pane can be windowed, dragged, and docked anywhere within {{ en.RDM }}.

To learn how to create a tab group, refer to [***Grouped Tab Bar***](/rdm/windows/commands/view/layout/grouped-tab-bar/).
