***Import with Network Scan*** allows you to perform a network scan based on a predefined range of IP addresses to find sessions to import. It can be accessed via the ***File â€“ Import*** menu or by right-clicking in the {{ en.NPANE }} and selecting ***Import***.

Specify a scan range, then, once the scan is completed, select the sessions you wish to import (by default, all sessions are selected) and click ***OK*** to import the sessions in your data source.

{% snippet, "badgeCaution" %}
If you wish to review every session one by one as they are imported, you can check the ***Edit imported entry*** option. However, this is not recommend for a large number of sessions.
