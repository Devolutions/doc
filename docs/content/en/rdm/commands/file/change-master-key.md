Use ***File â€“ Change Master Key*** to encrypt the data source.  

The master key prevents unauthorized users to access the data source without knowing the master key. It is highly recommended to apply a master key to the data source if you are using {{ en.RDM }} in a portable environment (i.e., USB Flash Drive, USB Hard Drive).  

A master key can be used with the following data sources:  

* {{ en.DOD }} 
* Dropbox 
* Google Drive 
* XML 
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
Since version 14.0.4.0, the user is automatically prompted to add a master key when connecting to one of the above mentioned data sources for the first time. The master key is completely optional (yet highly recommended).

It is generally recommended to apply a Master Key to your XML or Dropbox Data Sources as it adds another layer of security protecting your Remote Sessions.  

The use of a Master Key function will stop unauthorized users from being able to easily see/access the stored Sessions within your Data Source.  

{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %} 
If you ever lose your master key it will be impossible for us to recover your data. Please ensure that you remember or backup your master key in a safe place.
