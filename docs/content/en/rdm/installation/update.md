When a new {{ en.RDM }} version is available, an update window appears in your application prompting you to update. It also displays the ***Release Notes*** (new features, improvements, fices, breaking changes).

You have the option to download the latest version, skip it, or have {{ en.RDM }} notify you about the update at a later time.
