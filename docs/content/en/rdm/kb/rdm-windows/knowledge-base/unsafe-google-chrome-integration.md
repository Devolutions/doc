The integration of Google Chrome within {{ en.RDMWIN }} relies on a third-party component. Consequently, we do not control the update frequency of the Chromium versions utilized by this component.

The current integrated version of Chromium is 120, which suffers from several critical vulnerabilities due to the lack of the latest security patches.

For user safety, we issue a warning regarding the use of this integration. If you must use it for compatibility reasons, we strongly advise only browsing trusted websites. For optimal security, we recommend switching to the default browser powered by Microsoft Edge.

We are actively investigating options to transition to an open-source component for this integration. However, implementing this change will take some time.

We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work towards enhancing the security and functionality of {{ en.RDMWIN }}.
