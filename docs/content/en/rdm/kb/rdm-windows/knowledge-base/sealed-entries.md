Sealed entries protect sensitive information from being accessed by users with higher privileges and can be used in case of emergency. When an attempt is made to access a sealed entry, the system displays a confirmation message to the user, indicating that the entry is protected. Additionally, a notification is sent to the administrators, alerting them of the access attempt.
