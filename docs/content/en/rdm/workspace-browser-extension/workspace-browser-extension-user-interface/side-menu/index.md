Your custom password is generated at the top of the ***Content Area*** with a strenght indicator below it. You can copy it or generate a new one using the ***Copy to Clipboard*** and ***Generate Password*** buttons respectively. The ***Password lenght***, which is set to 12 by default, can also be adjusted.

In the ***General*** drop-down section, you are able to select the types of characters that your password must contain as well as the minimum number of characters of each type that must be included.
