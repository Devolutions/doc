The ***{{ en.DOD }}*** is a free cloud file storage service with no limitations and perfect for standalone users. You can store and synchronize your entries online and access your sessions from anywhere.

{% snippet, "shieldWarning" %}
Even though this is a cloud service, you MUST use our [{{ en.OBACK }}](/cloud/rdm-online-services/online-backup/) service to keep history of your data. Since Devolutions offers a free backup service, we do not maintain multiple versions of the {{ en.DOD }} content. This makes it critical that you enable the backup feature. This service will keep multiple versions of your file and is the best option.
