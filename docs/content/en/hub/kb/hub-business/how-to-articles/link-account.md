The ***Linked account*** feature allows users to associate another account under the same user. This feature is particularly beneficial when a user needs to manage different accounts simultaneously. For instance, a user may have an account with the email address "bob@windjammer.co" and another account with the email address "_bob@windjammer.co", which serves as an elevated or privileged account.

The primary purpose of ***Linked account*** is to enhance user convenience and streamline account management.
{% snippet, "badgeInfo" %}
Only one license is needed for each ***Linked account*** pair.
