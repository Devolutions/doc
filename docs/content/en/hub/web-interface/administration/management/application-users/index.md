***Application identities*** are created to be used to connect with applications like the {{ en.PS }} module. Create, manage, and delete them in ***Administration – Application identities***.

Application identities require the following:
* An access to {{ en.DHUBB }} with a valid {{ en.DA }}.
* A user with the right permissions to add application identities.
