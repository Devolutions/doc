  title: "{{ en.CTOOLS }} access"
---
As an administrator to your {{ en.DHUBB }}, you can disable or enable the use of {{ en.CTOOLS }} for specific users that are not administrators.  

{% snippet, "badgeNotice" %} 
To reduce the number of inquiries from your users, we recommend that you inform them before changing their access to {{ en.DHUB }} via their {{ en.CTOOLS }}, especially if you disable their access. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
These settings can be configured in ***Administration â€“ Users*** when [creating and inviting a user](/hub/web-interface/administration/management/users/create-invite-users/) or after the fact by editing the user. This only affects the user for whom the settings have been changed.  

Access to {{ en.CTOOLS }} can be configured separately for the {{ en.WBEX }} and {{ en.WAPPS }}. The settings are enabled by default.
