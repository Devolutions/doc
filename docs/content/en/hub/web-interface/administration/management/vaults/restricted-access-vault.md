Administrators can allow users to view specific folders or entries in a {{ en.VLT }}. The ***Restricted {{ en.VLT }} role*** is assigned at the {{ en.VLT }} level. Users or groups with this setting will see only the {{ en.VLT }} content that they have permission to view.

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %}
This functionality is also fully compatible with {{ en.RDM }}, the {{ en.WAPPS }} (mobile and desktop), and the {{ en.WBEX }}.

1. In the folder’s properties or entries, give users/groups the desired access by clicking on ***Edit***.

Once this is done, affected users will only see what they have permission to access. Here is a example with the Admin/Manager view on the left, and the user (with reduced access) view on the right.
