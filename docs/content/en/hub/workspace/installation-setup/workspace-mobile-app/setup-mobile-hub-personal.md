Before using your application, you will have to complete a quick setup that involves selecting your Devolutions product(s), connecting to your {{ en.DA }}, and configuring some security settings.

## {{ en.WMAPP }} Setup

Follow the steps below to perform the initial configuration of your {{ en.WMAPP }} with {{ en.DHUBP }}:

1. After the installation is complete, open the application.
1. In the ***{{ en.WS }} Setup***, check ***{{ en.DHUBP }}***, then tap on ***Start Setup***.
