  title: Change Gravatar
---
The default user avatar in {{ en.DVLS }} is the user initials.

{% snippet, "badgeInfo" %}
The use of an avatar, other than the initials, is only available when the option is enabled in ***Administration – Server Settings – Features – Enable Gravatar***.
{% endsnippet %}

Users can change the avatar and use an image uploaded at [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/) by entering the email associated with the Gravatar account.
