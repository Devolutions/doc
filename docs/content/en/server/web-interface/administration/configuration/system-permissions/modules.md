Determine who can manage ***{{ en.DGW }}*** and ***Privileged access***. By default, the value is set to ***Default (Disallowed)***, but you can also set it to ***Custom***, ***Allowed***, or ***Disallowed***. If you select ***Custom***, a window will prompt you to granularly grant access to specific users, user groups, and/or applications.
