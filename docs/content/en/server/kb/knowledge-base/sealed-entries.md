Sealed entries can be used in case of emergency. When an attempt is made to access a sealed entry, the system displays a confirmation message to the user, indicating that the entry is protected. Additionally, a notification is sent to the administrators, alerting them of the access attempt.

 ### Sealing the entry

1. Go to the properties of the entry.
1. Click ***Security Settings***.
1. Select ***Sealed*** under ***Seal State***.
1. Click ***Update*** to save.

 ### Access Attempts

Unseal an entry sends a notification to the administrators, providing details about the access attempt. This includes the identity of the user attempting access, the time and date of the attempt, and the name of the {{ en.VLT }}.

### Notification preferences

Enable and disable sealed entries [notifications](/server/web-interface/account-menu/notifications-preferences/) under ***Security â€“ Entry unsealed***.
