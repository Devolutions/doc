{% endsnippet %}

## Software requirements

* Windows Server 2016, 2019, or 2022 with .NET Framework 4.8
* Ubuntu Linux 20.04, 22.04 with PowerShell 7

## Prerequisites

* {{ en.DVLS }} Free, Team, Enterprise, or Platinum Edition.
* A license is required for each deployed {{ en.DGW }}. Contact our [sales department](mailto:sales@devolutions.net) for more information.
    * If {{ en.DGW }} is installed side by side with {{ en.DVLS }} on the same server, it supports up to 5 concurrent sessions without a license.
* For MSPs, one {{ en.DGW }} can be deployed per customer site. Â All you need is to keep the {{ en.DGW }} servers reachable by both {{ en.DVLS }} and {{ en.RDM }}. {{ en.DGW }} only needs to accept inbound connections coming from them. No outbound connections to {{ en.DVLS }} and {{ en.RDM }} are required.
