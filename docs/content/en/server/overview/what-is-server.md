{{ en.DVLS }} is an on‑premises solution for storing and sharing information across your whole organization. Manage remote connections, credentials, and sensitive information with ease.

Use our ***User Groups Based Access Control*** to grant permissions in a granular fashion. Advanced logging of all user activity is included to offer visibility in all aspects of the solution.

Because of its web architecture, you can offer {{ en.DVLS }} only from your intranet or publish it online.

There are two ways of using {{ en.DVLS }}:

| ![!!clip10056](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/en/server/clip10056.png)<br><br>**Web-based {{ en.VLT }}**<br><br>Web browser access and [{{ en.WBEX }}](/server/workspace-browser-extension/overview/) | ![!!Application64x64](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/common/Application64x64.png)<br><br>**Session management**<br><br>Using a client application (desktop or mobile) |

| Access {{ en.VLT }} resources from a web browser using a Client Access License (CAL). Credentials are managed directly from the web interface, and no client application is required.<br><br>With the {{ en.WBEX }}, credentials can be automatically submitted when connecting to a website. | Access {{ en.VLT }} resources using our client applications, which communicate with {{ en.DVLS }} web services. A local installation of a client application such as {{ en.RDM }} is required to manage the data source and its resources.
