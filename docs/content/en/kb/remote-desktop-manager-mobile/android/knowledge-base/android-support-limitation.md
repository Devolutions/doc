Devolutions will ensure compatibility of {{ en.RDM }} with the current version of the Android operating system (OS) and the three major versions that directly precede it (e.g., from Android 14 to Android 11).

A “major version” is defined as an official and numbered release that includes significant changes, enhancements, or updates (e.g., Android 13 to Android 14). It is the user’s responsibility to ensure that their device is operating a version of the mobile OS that is supported by {{ en.RDM }}.

Compatibility with earlier OS versions is not guaranteed and may result in diminished functionality or inoperability. Devolutions shall not be liable for any failure, inability to perform, or performance issues of {{ en.RDM }} arising due to its use on unsupported or outdated versions of mobile operating systems, and reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to determine the support end date for older versions of mobile operating systems.
