On the Apple Store, search for the {{ en.RDM }} application and install the application on your device.

When launching the application on your device, the ***Master password*** window will appear, you can either decide to enter a password protecting {{ en.RDM }}, which will prompt you for your password every time you open the application or if you leave the field blank the application will open without prompting you for a password. You can also choose to use ***Touch ID*** and ***Face ID***.
