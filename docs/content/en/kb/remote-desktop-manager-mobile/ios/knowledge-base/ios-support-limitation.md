{{ en.RDM }} will support the current version of the iOS operating system (OS) and up to one major version that directly precedes it.

A “major version” is defined as an official and numbered release that includes significant changes, enhancements, or updates (e.g., iOS 16 to iOS 17). It is the user’s responsibility to ensure that their device is operating a version of the mobile OS that is supported by {{ en.RDM }}.

Compatibility with earlier OS versions is not guaranteed and may result in diminished functionality or inoperability. Devolutions shall not be liable for any failure, inability to perform, or performance issues of RDM arising due to its use on unsupported or outdated versions of mobile operating systems, and reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to determine the support end date for older versions of mobile operating systems.
