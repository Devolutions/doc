  title: Launch a session from the {{ en.WDAPP }}
  description: This topic covers the two ways to launch a session from the {{ en.WDAPP }}.
---
It is possible to launch a session in {{ en.RDM }} or in {{ en.DLAUNCHER }} through the [UI](#launch-through-ui). However it is also possible to optimize this process and only have to [double-click an entry](#launch-through-double-click) to launch it.

## Launch through UI
Select the desired entry and click on ***Open in {{ en.RDM }}*** or ***Open in {{ en.DLAUNCHER }}***.

![Open in {{ en.DLAUNCHER }}](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/docs_en_kb_KB0146.png)

## Launch through double-click
1. In the {{ en.WDAPP }}, click go to ***File – {{ en.WS }} settings – Entries***.
1. Enable the ***Launch session directly*** option and choose between {{ en.RDM }} and {{ en.DLAUNCHER }}.
