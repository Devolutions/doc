## Settings

To show the ***Copy Custom Fields*** button in the ***Home*** menu, you need to hide the value of the ***Custom Fields*** in the ***Properties*** of the entry. The value of a hidden custom field is encrypted and protected with the ***View sensitive*** permission.

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %}
Changing the ***Custom Field*** tag name will be reflected in the ***Home*** menu tab.
