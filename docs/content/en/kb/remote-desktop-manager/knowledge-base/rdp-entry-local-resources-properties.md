### Sound hook

| ***Medium***             | Offer a balance between audio quality and bandwidth usage, designed for average network conditions           |
| ***Default (Dynamic)***  | The default setting, which dynamically adjusts audio quality based on network conditions to ensure the best possible performance. |

### Remote audio recording

Allow or restrict the redirection of audio input from the local computer microphone to the remote desktop session.

| SETTINGS | DESCRIPTION    |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Do not record             | Disable audio recording from the local computer's microphone during the RDP session. No audio input from the local machine will be captured or transmitted to the remote system. |
| Record from this computer | Enable audio recording from the local computer's microphone, allowing the audio input to be redirected and used in the remote session. This is useful for applications or services on the remote desktop that require audio input from the user.  |

## Keyboard 

This setting determines how Windows key combinations (e.g., <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>TAB</kbd>) are handled during a remote desktop session

| SETTINGS                        | DESCRIPTION |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| ***On the local computer*** | Windows key combinations are applied on the local computer. For instance, pressing <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>TAB</kbd> will switch between applications on the local machine, not the remote desktop. |
| ***On the Remote Computer*** | This option redirects Windows key combinations to the remote computer, so pressing <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>TAB</kbd> will switch between applications on the remote desktop. |
| ***In Full Screen Mode Only*** |With this setting, Windows key combinations are applied to the remote computer only when the RDP session is in full-screen mode. If the session is windowed, the key combinations affect the local computer. |
| ***Default (On the Local Computer)*** | The default behavior is to apply Windows key combinations on the local computer. |

### Keyboard layout
