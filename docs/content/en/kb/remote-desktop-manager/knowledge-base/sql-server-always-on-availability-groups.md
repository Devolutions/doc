  title: SQL Server always on availability groups
---
Main {{ en.RDM }} clients and {{ en.DVLS }} are written using the .Net platform, which means that the capabilities are often derived from .Net libraries themselves.  

As such, supported availability groups are a feature of the database driver used. All types are therefore supported:  

* Multi-Subnet Failover  
* Application Intent  
* Read-Only Routing  
* Multi-Subnet Failover: Faster Single Subnet Endpoint Failover  
* Multi-Subnet Failover: Named Instance Resolution For SQL Clustered Instances
