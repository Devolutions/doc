When you launch {{ en.RDM }}, the ***Welcome*** page appears to assist you in beginning your journey with the application. If you prefer not to see this page each time you launch your application, there are two methods to disable it. There is also an option to set a [custom welcome page](#custom-welcome-page).

## First method
If you have not closed the ***Welcome*** page yet, click on ***Don't show again*** in the upper left corner.

## Second method
In ***File – Options – User Interface***, uncheck the advanced option ***Show Welcome page at start-up***.

## Custom welcome page
You can also choose to show a custom page of your own as the welcome page. In ***Administration – System Settings – Application Specific – Applications***, under ***Welcome Page***, enable the ***Use web or html welcome page*** option and enter the URL that points to your custom welcome page.
