  title: Adding a new entry in the {{ en.UVLT }} on SQL Azure does not work
---
You are able to create new entries inside the shared {{ en.VLT }}, but not in the {{ en.UVLT }} You create the new entry, but it never appears under the {{ en.UVLT }}.

## Solution
Make sure that the user that you are using to authenticate on the Azure SQL datasource has been created under ***Administration â€“ Users*** in {{ en.RDM }}.  

If the user is missing, the {{ en.UVLT }} feature for this user will not work.
