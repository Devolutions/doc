[{{ en.DSEND_STANDALONE }}](https://devolutions.net/devolutions-send/) features a secure method to generate a link to share secrets instead of using insecure email to send sensitive data.

## Features
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %}
The in-app version of {{ en.DSEND }} is currently under development and will be progressively deployed in {{ en.RDM }}, {{ en.DVLS }}, and {{ en.DHUB }}. More information will come in the future.
{% endsnippet %}  

Despite sharing the same underlying architecture, slight differences exist between the feature set of the standalone and in-app versions of {{ en.DSEND }}.

* Unique short-lived (24-hour) link encrypted on the client side.
* Optional protection via a client-provided passphrase.
* Users may be non-Devolutions users (not linked to a {{ en.DA }}).
* Character limit of 10 kb.
* A sender email is required and stored with the GUID as part of the “payload” stored in the database.

## How to use {{ en.DSEND_STANDALONE }}
1. Go to the [{{ en.DSEND_STANDALONE }}](https://send.devolutions.com/) website.
1. Enter the ***Sender email***, which is required and stored with the GUID as part of the “payload” stored in the database.
1. Enter your ***Secure message*** to encrypt.
1. Add a ***Passphrase*** for extra security (mandatory if the recipient does not have a {{ en.DA }}, optional otherwise).
1. Read and agree to our [online services terms](https://devolutions.net/legal/online-services-terms/).
1. Click on ***Create secure link*** to get your in-browser encrypted, 24-hour short-lived link.

## Technical details
The core tenant of {{ en.DSEND }} is that Devolutions itself cannot decrypt the user's secret. This is accomplished via client-side (browser) encryption through a Rust program compiled to WASM (WebAssembly) in-browser. Therefore, Devolutions does not hold the encryption key and cannot decrypt the data.

The {{ en.DSEND_STANDALONE }} server application is built on .NET 7 and runs on the [ASP.NET Core Runtime Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-aspnet) within Kubernetes. The Docker container itself is based on Debian 11.

### Generating the secure link
For {{ en.DSEND_STANDALONE }}, a shareable link is generated. An appended URI fragment contains the client-side generated encryption key created via the [Rust OsRng](https://docs.rs/rand/latest/rand/rngs/struct.OsRng.html) method. The format of the link is as follows:  

**https://send.devolutions.com/receive/0000000-0000-0000-0000000#ThisIsTheKey**  

The link comprises a GUID and appended encryption key via the URI fragment. As stated in the W3C specifications, the fragment may not be sent for server logging or via the referer header, so server leakage should not occur.

* [Referrer policy](https://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy/#strip-url)
* [RFC 7231: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content - Section 5.5.2: Referer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-5.5.2)
* [RFC 7231: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content - Section 9.5: Disclosure of Fragment after Redirects](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-9.5)
* [RFC 3986: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax - Section 3.5: Fragment](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.5)  

The server generates a [v4 GUID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.guid.newguid?view=net-7.0) via the `Guid.NewGuid` method using the Linux system CSPRNG for entropy.  

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %}
"On non-Windows platforms, starting with .NET 6, this function calls the OS's underlying cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate 122 bits of strong entropy. In previous versions of .NET, the entropy is not guaranteed to be generated by a CSPRNG."
Source: [Guid.NewGuid Method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.guid.newguid?view=net-7.0)
{% endsnippet %}  

For Debian 11 and most Linux OS, the CSPRNG referenced within .NET is called `uuid_generate_random`, which defaults to using `/dev/urandom`.

The client-side encryption algorithm used is [XChaCha20Poly1305](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305) with random nonces (number used once) added for symmetric encryption, similar to {{ en.DHUB }}. The cryptography used is in the open-source Devolutions Crypto library: [GitHub - Devolutions/devolutions-crypto: Devolutions Cryptographic Library](https://github.com/Devolutions/devolutions-crypto).

### In-transit encryption
The encryption in transit is via TLS from the client to the application server and from the application server to the [MongoDB Atlas database](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database). TLS 1.2+, using newer versions such as 1.3 when possible, is used with strong [ciphers](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/configmap/#ssl-ciphers). The TLS configuration is the [default Kubernetes ingress controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/tls/#default-tls-version-and-ciphers%5D(https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/tls/#default-tls-version-and-ciphers)), with the following default cipher set:  

```
ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
```

### Server-side storage
On the server side, all data is stored and encrypted at rest via a [MongoDB Atlas database](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database). MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-hosted database deployed to a customer's cloud provider. Devolutions has this database deployed to its Azure tenant but does not use a customer key implementation.

This means that, technically, MongoDB is storing the at-rest encryption keys for the database. However, potential issues are mitigated as {{ en.DSEND_STANDALONE }} users URI secret link fragments (the key) are not stored.

Additionally, access to the database is restricted to just the {{ en.DSEND }} application server and administrative access as needed. The database has no backup policy, as the data is not intended to be stored past 24 hours.

### Server-side logging
As Cloudflare is reverse proxying the {{ en.DSEND }} service, server-side logs are collected. However, this is limited to standard Cloudflare server-side logging and does not include real-user monitoring, potentially containing more information. This is currently recorded in Cloudflare and pushed to Datadog for retention.

Datadog has an indefinite retention policy, where logs older than 15 days are moved to an Azure Storage account. But Datadog can “rehydrate” the records for viewing at any time. The two components of {{ en.DSEND }}, `send-api` and `send-client`, output minimal logging. The API component only outputs diagnostic messages, but since the client is outputting HTML, Cloudflare server-side tracking comes into play.

#### Cloudflare server-side tracking elements
The relevant elements tracked by Cloudflare for user data are below which are then pushed to DataDog for retention.  
* IP address
* User agents

### Client-side logging
Every effort is taken to limit the cookies used, and the only ones used are for the [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) service intended for use in bot and spam detection. The data pulled from hCaptcha is outlined in their [Privacy Policy](https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy).
