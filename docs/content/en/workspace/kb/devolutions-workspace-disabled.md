After the Manifest V3 update, your Google Chrome browser may display an error message stating "{{ en.DWS }} is disabled".
![{{ en.DWS }} is disabled](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/INTERFACE2035.png)
To resolve this, click on the error message, and the browser will prompt you to accept the required permissions to re-enable the extension. You need to do this to continue using the {{ en.WBEX }}. This is a one-time action and will not be asked again.
