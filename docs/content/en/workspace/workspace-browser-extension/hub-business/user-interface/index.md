The {{ en.WBEX }} user interface is slightly different in your browser depending on the Devolutions product used in conjunction with the extension. This topic will present the {{ en.WBEX }} user interface when used with {{ en.DHUBB }}.

The main view, which is the one displayed when first opening the {{ en.WBEX }} in your browser, can be divided into three main sections:

1. The ***Top Menu*** gives you access to some {{ en.WBEX }} functionalities and settings.
1. The ***Side menu*** is directly linked to the central panel, as each tab changes what is displayed in the window depending on its function.
1. The ***Content Area*** is where information will be displayed and where you can interact with {{ en.WBEX }} functionalities corresponding to the different tabs.

### Top Menu

If you use multiple Devolutions products with the extension, you can switch between them using the ***Data Source Selector*** at the left of the ***Top Menu***. A drop-down list will appear with the other products you have previously paired with the {{ en.WBEX }}.

* the ***{{ en.UVLT_MAJ }}*** tab, where you can find the entries you stored in your {{ en.DHUBB }} ***{{ en.UVLT }}***, divided into your different folders.
* the ***Password Generator*** tab, where you can create a strong and secure password for a new account.
