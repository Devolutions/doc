  description: 
---

Administrators can allow users to view specific folders or entries in a vault. The ***Restricted vault role*** is assigned at the vault level. Users or groups with this setting will see only the vault content that they have permission to view.

This functionality is also fully compatible with Remote Desktop Manager, Workspace (Desktop, Mobile), and the browser extension.

1. Select the vault and click on the three dots to edit the vault’s permissions.

Once this is done, affected users will only see what they have permission to access. Here is a example with the Admin/Manager view on the left, and the user (with reduced access) view on the right.
