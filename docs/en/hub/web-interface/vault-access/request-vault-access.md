1. Write a short message to the approver explaining why the access to this vault is needed. The message is optional, but we recommend it as it allows the administrator or vault owner to make a more informed decision.
1. Click on ***Send Access Request***.

You now have to wait for the approver to respond to your request. If they approve your request, the vault will appear in the vault selector drop-down menu with the other vaults you already have access to.
