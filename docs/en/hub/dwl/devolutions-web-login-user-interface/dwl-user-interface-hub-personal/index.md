The {{ en.DWL }} user interface is slightly different in your browser depending on the Devolutions product used in conjunction with the extension. This topic will present the {{ en.DWL }} user interface when used with {{ en.DHUBP }}.  

The main view, which is the one displayed when first opening {{ en.DWL }} in your browser, can be divided into three main sections:  

1. The ***Top Menu*** gives you access to some {{ en.DWL }} functionalities and settings. 
1. The window depending on its function. 
1. The ***Content Area*** is where information will be displayed and where you can interact with {{ en.DWL }} functionalities corresponding to the different tabs.

### Top Menu 

If you use multiple Devolutions products with the extension, you can switch between them using the ***Data Source Selector*** at the left of the ***Top Menu***. A drop-down list will appear with the other products you have previously paired with {{ en.DWL }}.
