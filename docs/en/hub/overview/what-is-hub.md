{{ en.DHUB }} is a highly secure team-based password manager that is part of the {{ en.DCS }}. It has been designed for both IT administrators and end users to store and share information across the whole organization, no matter the size. You can access and manage sensitive information from anywhere and with any supported web browser.  

Your information is stored in entries of different types which are organized into {{ en.VLT }}s. Entries are managed directly from the web interface and no client application is required.  

Security is at the core of {{ en.DHUB }} since it is hosted by [Microsoft Azure](/kb/hub-business/knowledge-base/hosting-region-password-hub/), a highly trusted cloud services provider, and encrypted with the strongest encryption standard: AES-256.  

{{ en.DHUB }} possesses powerful user management features, reports, and accessibility options. Users can be assigned roles and permissions and can also be members of user groups with predefined roles and permissions, streamlining the onboarding process.  

{{ en.DHUB }} can be used in combination with our {{ en.RDM }} as a data source as well as with other Devolutions products and {{ en.CTOOLS }}, which you can find below.
