The ***Check-out*** feature allows users to request temporary access to a privileged account entry in a PAM {{ en.VLT }}. The approver must then approve or deny the request.

1. Write a short ***Comment*** to the approver explaining why you want access to this entry.

1. When you are done, click on ***Request check-out***.

You now have to wait for the approver to respond to your request. You will be notified by email whether the answer is positive or negative. The next section details what to do once you have received a response.

## Response to your request

If your request is approved, your email will have a button at the bottom that will bring you directly to your entry in {{ en.DHUBB }}. It is also possible to manually go to your entry.

Once you are on the entry in the PAM {{ en.VLT }}, you will see at the top that your check-out request has been approved and that the entry is already checked out by you. A check mark validates that your request was approved. Next to the check mark is the ***Time remaining*** on your request. There is also a ***View Details*** option which is described in the next section.

You can now perform your task with this privileged account.

## View details and check in the privileged account entry

***View Details*** allows you to see information about your check-out request as well as check in the entry.

In the top section, you can view the ***Requested duration*** and the ***Time remaining*** on your access. The approver can modify your requested duration if necessary.

Further down is your message and the approver's message.

Finally, you can check in your privileged account entry by clicking on ***Check In***. You can also use the button you used to check out the entry to check it in. After being checked in, the privileged account password resets and the old password is rendered useless. Be sure you want to do this first, since in order to regain access to your entry, you will need to make another request. Otherwise, your access will end within the time frame set by you and the approver.
