{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
The {{ en.UVLT }} is available for all [Advanced Data Sources](/rdm/windows/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/).

## A note on Credentials 

Credentials in the {{ en.UVLT }} can be used in two ways:  

1. From a session using the ***{{ en.UVLT }} search***. 
1. When using the ***User Specific Settings*** feature. 

These restrictions can easily be understood when you keep in mind that the {{ en.UVLT }} is in fact contained in the user area of the database. It must be used from within the {{ en.UVLT }}, or by using our extension mechanism that is user specific.
