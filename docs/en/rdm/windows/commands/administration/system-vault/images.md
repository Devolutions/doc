{{ en.RDM }}'s global image management uses a dynamic form to easily create virtual folders and subfolders for image storage.

The following file types are currently supported for global and custom images: 
* .jpg 
* .jpeg
* .bmp
* .png
* .svg 
* .ico

1. Go to ***Administration*** – ***Images*** in the ribbon of {{ en.RDM }}.

1. The ***Entry Image Management*** window open.
1. Click ***Add (+)*** to choose an image.

 You can add a subfolder by adding a `\` in the ***Folder*** field. Clicking on a virtual folder will not display the contents of its subfolder, since it is possible to have an image only in a virtual folder.
