  title: Clean up deleted history
---
The ***Clean Up Deleted History*** option permanently deletes the history from the ***Deleted Entries*** window, making it impossible to restore deleted entries unless you made a backup. The entry history can still be found under ***Reports*** â€“ ***Activity Logs***.

This feature requires an [Advanced Data Source](/rdm/windows/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/).
