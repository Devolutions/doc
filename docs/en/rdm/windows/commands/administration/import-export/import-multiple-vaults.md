  title: Import multiple vaults
---
The ***Import Multiple {{ en.VLT }}s (.rdx)*** function lets you import one or more {{ en.VLT }}s at a time. Learn how in [Export and import vaults](/kb/remote-desktop-manager/how-to-articles/export-import-vaults/). 

{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %} 
The {{ en.VLT }}s you want to import must have been previously exported using the ***Export All {{ en.VLT }}s (.rdx)***, because they need to be in the .rdx format.
