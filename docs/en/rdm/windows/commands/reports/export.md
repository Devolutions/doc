The Export Reports is a way to execute and export reports through a command line. You can use this feature in a shortcut or in a batch file and use the Windows task scheduler to execute it.  

You will be able to export Data Report, Inventory report as well as most of the reports found in our Generate Report list except for the Password Usage.

You must have the rights to run report in {{ en.RDM }} to use this feature.
