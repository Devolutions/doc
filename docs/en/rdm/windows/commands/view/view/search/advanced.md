The Advanced Search allows you to search for entries and folders based on multiple criteria in one {{ en.VLT }} at a time. To search multiple {{ en.VLT }}s simultaneously, please refer to [***Multi {{ en.VLT }} Search***](/rdm/windows/commands/view/view/search/multi-vault/).  

The ***Advanced Search*** is available in the ribbon of {{ en.RDM }} or by pressing  <kbd>F11</kbd> on your keyboard.

It is possible to select multiple entries at once by <kbd>Shift</kbd>-clicking or all of them with the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> shortcut. Right-clicking one or more entries shows the same menu and options as in the ***{{ en.NPANE }}***.
