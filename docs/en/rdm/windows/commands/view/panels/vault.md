  title: '{{ en.VLT }}s'

***{{ en.VLT }}*** are containers for your entries, your credentials, sensitive information, sessions, and more.  
![{{ en.VLT }}s](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/rdm/windows/RDMWin2014.png) 

You will start with two {{ en.VLT }}s:  

* One main default ***{{ en.VLT }}*** created for sharing entries to team members that you grant access to. You can add and share more {{ en.VLT }}s in ***Administration – {{ en.VLT }}s***. 
* One ***{{ en.UVLT }}***, which is user-centric and is used to store information such as personal account credentials. The ***{{ en.UVLT }}*** prevents users from using a non-secured tool to manage their personal passwords at work. The ***{{ en.UVLT }}*** can be disabled in ***Administration – System Settings – {{ en.UVLT }}***. 

The two {{ en.VLT }} types can also be found in the ***{{ en.NPANE }}*** menu.
