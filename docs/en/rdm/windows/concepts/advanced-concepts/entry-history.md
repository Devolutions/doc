The ***Entry History*** feature allows you to view and compare information regarding different versions of your sessions. For example; I make a change to an entry accidentally and don’t know what could’ve happened. I can go to the entry history and restore the entry back to before I made these changes and the entry now works as it did previously. Meanwhile, the ***Deleted Entries*** feature lets you view or restore deleted entries (similar to a recycle bin with Windows) or permenantly delete entries that have expired, or simply aren’t useful to you.
