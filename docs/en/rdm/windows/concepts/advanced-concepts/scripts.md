  title: Scripts
  description: Streamline and optimize your {{ en.RDM }} usage by executing PowerShell scripts that are consolidated in the data source on one or multiple machines at the same time rather than running them one by one manually on each separate machine.
---
With {{ en.RDM }}, automate processes through scripts written in PowerShell, AutoHotKey, AutoIt, VBScript, and others. Save scripts in individual {{ en.VLT }}s or store in the System Vault to share across multiple vaults. Run scripts locally or remotely on one or many different systems.
