The use of permissions allows granular control over who can view, modify, or delete specific data or functionality within {{ en.RDM }}. RBAC simplifies the process by grouping users into predefined roles, each with a set of associated permissions. You can also assign permissions to an object. This object can be the root folder, a folder, or an entry. Permissions can also be applied at the system level and to a PAM vault.
