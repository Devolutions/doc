  description: "{{ en.RDM }} enforces two successive authentication steps to grant access to the data source. Multi-factor authentication is integrated directly in the software and credentials are brokered on behalf of the user when launching a connection, preventing the user from ever knowing the credentials."

Central to {{ en.RDM }} is security. Sensitive fields, such as passwords, are always encrypted regardless of the [data source](/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/data-sources/) used. With Microsoft SQL Server (and Azure SQL Server) data sources, add a [Security Providers](/rdm/windows/commands/administration/settings/security-providers/) to ensure configuration data is unreadable even on direct access database access.

Further, protect direct {{ en.RDM }} access through an [application password](/kb/remote-desktop-manager/knowledge-base/rdm-security-dashboard/#configuration-files-should-be-encrypted-using-an-application-password) (further encrypting configuration files) and add [multi-factor authentication](/kb/remote-desktop-manager/how-to-articles/enable-2fa-users-sql-server/) (MFA) to protect against unauthorized access. Available for Advanced Data Sources, use roles, groups, and permissions with role-based access control](/rdm/windows/concepts/advanced-concepts/permissions-rbac-roles/) (RBAC) to properly lock entries, folders, and vaults to only those who need access.

{{ en.RDM }} seamlessly integrates with [{{ en.DVLS }}](/server/getting-started/), providing advanced [reporting & auditing](/rdm/windows/concepts/advanced-concepts/logs-reports-audits/) with intuitive web-based access. Taking the burden off teams is {{ en.RDM }}s [{{ en.DHUB }}](/hub/getting-started/create-hub/) integration, a cloud-based secure password manager for teams.
