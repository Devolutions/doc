When multiple users are using the same entries, being able to check out (then check in) a session makes it so another user sees that it is currently being in use, eliminating the risk of one user kickout another one out of the session, for example. If a user does not have access to an entry or a {{ en.VLT }}, they can request temporary access to it, which an administrator or someone with the right role has to approve, adding a layer of security to accessing entries.
