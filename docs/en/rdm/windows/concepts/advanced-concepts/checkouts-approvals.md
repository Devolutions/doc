  title: Checkouts and approvals
  description: When multiple users are using the same entries, being able to check out (then check in) a session makes it so another user sees that it is currently being in use, eliminating the risk of one user kickout another one out of the session, for example.
---
Avoid conflicts between users through session checkouts. Once checked out, a session locks to a particular user until checked in. For additional [security](/rdm/windows/concepts/advanced-concepts/security/), require approval on session access. For users without permission, allow [temporary access](/rdm/windows/user-interface/content-area/temporary-access/request-temporary-access/) once approved.
