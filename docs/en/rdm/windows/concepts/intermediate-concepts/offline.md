{{ en.RDM }}'s offline mode allows you to connect to a local copy of a [data source](https://docs.devolutions.net/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/data-sources/). Changes are saved locally and synchronized with the [data source](https://docs.devolutions.net/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/data-sources/) once it is back online. Entries can be accessed even if there is no connection to the database.
