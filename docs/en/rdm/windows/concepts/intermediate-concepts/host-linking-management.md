Centralize data in a single host entry, allowing to open multiple types of connection such as RDP, SSH, website, etc. without having to create them. Launch entries with [templates](https://docs.devolutions.net/rdm/windows/concepts/intermediate-concepts/templates/), meaning less data entries to manage, which saves time.
