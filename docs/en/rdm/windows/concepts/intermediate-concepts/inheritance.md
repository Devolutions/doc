Inheritance means that certain properties or attributes of a higher-level entry are automatically passed down to lower-level entries that inherit from it. This can be useful to set default attributes or even simplify management by only having to make changes at the inherited-level entry. Several pieces of information can be inherited, such as credentials, VPN configurations, and certain descriptive fields via child-level variables.
