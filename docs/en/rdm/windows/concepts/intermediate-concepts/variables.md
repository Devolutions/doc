Variables are versatile values that can be changed depending on the context. Multiple fields can host variables (in folders, entries, macros, and keyboard shortcuts, for example) to facilitate, optimize, and maximize the generic nature of certain procedures and information, such as credentials. Use pre-existing variables or create custom ones to suit your needs.
