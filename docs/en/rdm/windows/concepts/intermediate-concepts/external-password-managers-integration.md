Our advanced data sources include third-party password integrations that provide access to external password managers, making it easy to retrieve credentials and associate them with connections without leaving the application. This is especially valuable when dealing with large numbers of credentials in a third-party credential manager. Users have the flexibility to create a single entry with access to the entire third-party database or link the entry to a specific credential within the password manager, giving customizable integration options to meet individual needs.
