Our advanced [data sources](/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/data-sources/) include third-party password integrations that provide access to ***external password managers***, making it easy to retrieve credentials by fetching them and associating them with connections without leaving the application.

This is especially valuable when dealing with large numbers of credentials in a third-party credential manager. Users have the flexibility to create a single entry with access to the entire third-party database or link the entry to a specific credential within the password manager, giving customizable integration options to meet individual needs. {{ en.RDM }} does not keep credentials in memory, providing better [security](/rdm/windows/concepts/advanced-concepts/security/) management.
