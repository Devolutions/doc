  title: VPN/Tunnel/Gateway/Proxy
  description: Create a secure connection between a local and a remote computer by connecting a VPN, VPN group, tunnel, gateway, or proxy entry to one or multiple session entries.
---
Optimize your efficiency by centralizing your sessions to one VPN/Tunnel/Gateway entry, either by linking them to one VPN/Tunnel/Gateway/Proxy entry or by setting it up directly in the session entries. Automatically establish a connection with a VPN, VPN group, tunnel, gateway, or proxy when first accessing a linked session. The connection only happens once for all sessions and only ends when all linked sessions are closed. {{ en.RDM }} natively supports various VPN connection types. If the specific type you want is not currently supported, you can explore our add-ons and manage them using the ***Add-On Manager***.
