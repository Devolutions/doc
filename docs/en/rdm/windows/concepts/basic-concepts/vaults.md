Organize your folders and entries in different {{ en.VLT }}s in your data source to facilitate finding your information. {{ en.VLT }}s allow you to efficiently manage accesses by inviting only the users who should see the information in a certain {{ en.VLT }}. They improve the security and user experience of {{ en.RDM }}, as well as its performance by limiting the amount of entries that load at once. Each user also has a {{ en.UVLT }}, which is a user-centric {{ en.VLT }} that allows each user to create entries that only them can access.
