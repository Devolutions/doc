Organize your [folders](/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/folders/) and entries in different [{{ en.VLT }}s](/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/vaults/) in your [data source](/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/data-sources/) to facilitate finding your information. {{ en.VLT_MAJ }}s allow you to efficiently manage accesses by inviting only the users who should see the information in a certain ***{{ en.VLT }}***, also making it possible to organize them (and thereby users who have access to them) by department, client, physical site, etc. They improve the [security](/rdm/windows/concepts/advanced-concepts/security/) and user experience of {{ en.RDM }} as well as its performance by limiting the amount of entries that load at once. Each user also has a {{ en.UVLT }}, which is a user-centric {{ en.VLT }} that allows each user to create entries that only them can access.
