The ***Add-On Manager*** in {{ en.RDM }} helps you simplify the process of identifying, installing, and managing add-ons used to extend the application. This feature makes {{ en.RDM }} lighter to download and gives users the choice of which modules to add. For example, sessions such as ***MS Telnet***, additional [***VPNs***](/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/vpn-tunnel-gateway-proxy/), and ***Sophos Connect*** can be added as modules.
