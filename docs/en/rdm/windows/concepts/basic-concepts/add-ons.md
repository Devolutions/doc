The ***Add-On Manager*** in {{ en.RDM }} helps you simplify the process of identifying, installing and managing add-ons that are used to extend the application. This feature also makes {{ en.RDM }} lighter to download and lets users decide on certain modules to add. For example ***Sessions*** such as ***MS Telnet*** or [***VPN***'s](/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/vpn-tunnel-gateway-proxy/) such as ***Sophos Connect*** can be added as modules.
