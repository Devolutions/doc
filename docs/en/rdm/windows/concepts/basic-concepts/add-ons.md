The Add-on Manager in {{ en.RDM }} helps you simplify the process for identifying, installing and managing add-ons that are used to extend the application. Many add-ons were developed using RDMâ€™s SDK, such as:

* Application tool add-ons
* Data source add-ons
* Import add-ons (Filezilla, SecureCRT, etc.)
* Session tools add-ons (remote shutdown, whois...)
* Session type add-ons (Java Web Start, SQL Management Studio, etc.)
* VPN add-ons (OpenVPN, Nortel VPN, etc.)
* Data entry add-ons
