The ***Search*** lets the user quickly find what they need (entries, documentation, etc.). You can use the ***Advanced Search*** and apply filters to make the search as precise as it needs to be. It is also possible to search in the current [{{ en.VLT }}](/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/vaults/), {{ en.UVLT }}, or all {{ en.VLT }}s using the ***Multi {{ en.VLT }} search***.
