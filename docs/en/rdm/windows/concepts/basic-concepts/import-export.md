Importing/exporting entries (such as sessions, logins, contacts, and credentials) reduces the time needed to set up your [{{ en.VLT }}s](/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/vaults/), thus allowing you to move quickly from another solution to {{ en.RDM }}. To manage your [data source](/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/data-sources), you can also export an entire {{ en.VLT }} and its content, as well as a data source configuration, then re-import them in a new data source or {{ en.RDM }} instance.
