***Data sources*** are at the core of {{ en.RDM }} as they allow to centralize your connections, credentials, and other entry types into one local or shared database. regardless of your ***data source*** type, they allow users to optimize their individual and team workspaces.  

Advanced ***data sources*** like {{ en.DVLS }} and {{ en.DHUB }} take a step further by having one centralized database as a ***data source*** that can be shared among multiple members of a single team of technicians, which provides teams easier management of connections for their userbase as well as better control of permissions and privileges. They also allow you to have multiple {{ en.VLT }}s, which can then be used to divide entries to better organize them within {{ en.RDM }}.
