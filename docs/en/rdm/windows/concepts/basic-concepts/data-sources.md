Data sources are at the core of {{ en.RDM }} as they allow to centralize your connections, credentials, and other entry types into one local or shared database. regardless of your data source type, they allow users to optimize their individual and team workspaces.  

Advanced data sources like {{ en.DVLS }} and {{ en.DHUB }} take a step further by having one centralized database as a data source that can be shared among multiple members of a single team of technicians, which provides teams easier management of connections for their userbase as well as better control of permissions and privileges. They also allow you to have multiple {{ en.VLT }}s, which can then be used to divide entries to better organize them within {{ en.RDM }}.  

The ***Offline Mode*** allows you to have easy access to your entries, even when your connection to the database is unavailable. You can also manage whether those accessing this cache are allowed to be in Read-Only or can Read/Write over the entries while in Offline Mode, providing further security for your entries and user management even when your users are offline.
