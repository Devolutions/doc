Data sources are at the core of {{ en.RDM }} as they allow to centralize your connections, credentials, and other entry types into one local or shared database. Regardless of your data source type, they allow users to optimize their individual and team workspaces.  

Advanced data sources like {{ en.DVLS }} and {{ en.DHUB }} take it a step further by having one centralized database as a data source that can be shared among multiple members of a single team of technicians, which provides teams easier management of connections for their userbase as well as better control of [permissions](/rdm/windows/concepts/advanced-concepts/permissions-rbac-roles/) and privileges. They also allow you to have multiple [{{ en.VLT }}s](/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/vaults/), which can then be used to divide entries to better organize them within {{ en.RDM }}.
