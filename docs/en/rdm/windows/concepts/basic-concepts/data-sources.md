  title: Data sources
  description: Data sources are at the core of {{ en.RDM }} as they allow to centralize your connections, credentials, and other entry types into one local or shared database. Regardless of your data source type, they allow users to optimize their individual and team workspaces.
---
Data sources centralize your connections, credentials, and information into a local or shared database. With several data source types available, {{ en.RDM }} offers a flexible and secure option to segment and optionally share your environment.

With advanced data sources, such as {{ en.DVLS }} and {{ en.DHUB }}, divide your entries into [{{ en.VLT }}s](/rdm/windows/concepts/basic-concepts/vaults/), each with unique [permissions](/rdm/windows/concepts/advanced-concepts/permissions-rbac-roles/) and user privileges. The System Vault stores typical entries, such as VPNs and scripts, to share amongst all vaults, reducing duplication. Help your users keep their data safe with private [User Vaults](/rdm/windows/data-sources/user-vault/) and avoid unencrypted Word documents and sticky notes.
