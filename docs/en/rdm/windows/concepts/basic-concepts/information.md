An information entry can contain various data items such as account information, emails, passports, credit cards, licenses, and serial numbers. Unlike credential entries, information entries are meant to be shared. Therefore, the data in information entries is not encrypted. Its principal use in {{ en.RDM }} is to hold personal or company information that can be easily accessed by users with the right permissions.
