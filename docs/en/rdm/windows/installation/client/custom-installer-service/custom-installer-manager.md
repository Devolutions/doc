{% snippet icon.badgeNotice %} 
For stability reasons, in large installation bases, the latest official release is not available to the {{ en.CIS }} for an undetermined period while we ensure that no major issues are present. We recommend using this time with your organization to perform integration tests on a few workstations before upgrading your entire team.

The ***No Internet connection*** option in {{ en.RDM }} (***File*** – ***Option*** – ***Tools*** – ***Advanced***) must be disabled for the {{ en.CI }} to work.

1. If you do not have a {{ en.RDM }} Installer file (.rdi), leave the ***Create a configuration just for this package*** option enabled. If you have already created one, enable the ***Use existing Remote Desktop Installer (rdi) file*** option instead and select your file on your computer using the ellipsis button. 
1. Click on ***Create***. Skip to step 9 if you selected ***Use existing Remote Desktop Installer (rdi) file*** in the previous step. 
1. If you need to create a new configuration file, the ***Installer file generator*** window will open. See our [Option Selection](/rdm/windows/installation/client/custom-installer-service/installer-file-generator/option-selection/) guide for more information about the different options to choose from.
