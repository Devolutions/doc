## View temporary access requests 

To view all your past and current requests, you must use the following ***pending access requests*** box to open the ***Temporary Access Requests*** window.  
![Dashboard â€“ pending access requests](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/rdm/windows/RDMWin6010.png) 

In the ***Temporary Access Requests*** window, you can see all your temporary access requests and sort them by ***Status***, ***Username***, ***Data source user***, ***Entry***, ***Action***, ***Requested on***, ***Requested duration***, ***Requested start time***, ***Requested end time***, ***Authorized duration***, ***Authorized start time***, ***Authorized end time***, ***Authorizer username*** and ***Authorizer data source user***.
![Show Temporary Access Requests](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/rdm/windows/RDMWin6013.png) 

It is also possible to display only certain requests with the ***Status*** drop-down menu or with the filter bar at the top.  

Using ***View messages***, you can view the ***Request message*** and the ***Authorization message*** of a specific request.  
![Request messages](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/rdm/windows/RDMWin2076.png) 

Finally, clicking on ***Approve*** or ***Deny*** opens the ***Temporary Access Response*** window, which is described in the next section. 

## Approve/Deny temporary access requests

The duration of ***Temporary Access*** begins when the request is approved.

To respond to a request, you need to open the ***Temporary Access Response*** window. There are two ways to access it.  

The first option is to use the ***Pending Access Requests*** box (see image below) in the ***Overview*** tab of your ***Dashboard***. Clicking on either the green check mark (approve the request) or the red "X" (deny the request) next to a request will open the ***Temporary Access Response*** window.  
![Pending Access Requests](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/rdm/windows/RDMWin6015.png) 

The second option requires you to go through the other ***Pending Access Requests*** box described in the [previous section](#view-temporary-access-requests). Whatever way you choose to access the response window, the result will be the same.  
![Temporary Access Response](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/rdm/windows/RDMWin6014.png) 

This view is divided into two sections: 

* The ***Request Info*** section contains information about the user's request. Because this was done on the user's side, fields in this section cannot be edited. ***Entry's dependencies***, such as credentials and linked VPNs, are listed on the left menu.

* The ***Response Parameters*** section allows you to change the temporary access duration specified by the user. It is also possible to write a message to the user explaining your decision, but it remains optional. 

Clicking on ***Approve*** or ***Deny*** will approve or deny the request, depending on what you selected earlier. A confirmation window will pop up which you can make disappear by clicking on ***OK***.
