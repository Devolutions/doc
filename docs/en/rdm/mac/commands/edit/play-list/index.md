  title: Play list
---
The Play list feature in {{ en.RDMMAC }} is a lot like a music play list. The Play list can be used to create groups of sessions for a specific task or for security reasons. You can build your own Play list and start all entries from a Play list at the same time.  

The Play list feature is accessible from ***View â€“ Play list***.
