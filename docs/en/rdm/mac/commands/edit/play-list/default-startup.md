{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %}
If you check the Confirmation at startup box a confirmation window will be displayed before opening your Play list. You can then enable or disable sessions manually or you can cancel the process completely.
{% endsnippet %}

The last opened connections option will offer to reopen the sessions that were opened at the time you closed {{ en.RDMMAC }}. That Play list is maintained automatically at every {{ en.RDMMAC }} closing.
