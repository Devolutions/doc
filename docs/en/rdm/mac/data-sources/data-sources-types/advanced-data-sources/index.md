title: Advanced Data Sources
---
***Advanced Data Sources*** are highly configurable data sources, typically running on an advanced management system, such as a database management system or our own Devolutions online services.  

Advanced Data Sources greatly increase the set of managing features available to administrators, such as:  

* Document uploads and entry attachments. 
* Audit and logging. 
* Advanced security with [User Management](/rdm/mac/commands/administration/user-management/) and [Security Group Management (Legacy)](/rdm/mac/commands/administration/security-group-management/).  
* [Offline mode](/rdm/mac/commands/file/go-offline/). 
* [2-Factor Authentication](/rdm/mac/data-sources/multi-factor-authentication/).  

{% snippet icon.badgeWarning %}
Legacy security and security groups have been deprecated and will be completely removed starting with version 2023.3 of {{ en.RDM }}. See [Migrate from security groups to user groups](/kb/remote-desktop-manager/how-to-articles/migration-security-groups-user-groups/).

Currently, the Advanced Data Sources are:  
* [{{ en.DHUBB }}](/rdm/mac/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/hub-business/). 
* [{{ en.DVLS }}](/rdm/mac/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/server/). 
* [Microsoft Azure SQL](/rdm/mac/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/microsoft-azure-sql/). 
* [Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)](/rdm/mac/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/microsoft-sql-server/).
