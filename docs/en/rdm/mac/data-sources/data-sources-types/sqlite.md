{{ en.RDMMAC }} SQLite data source is ideal for single user in a stand alone situations. More powerful and more flexible than the XML file format, it also supports a few of the Advanced Data Source options like Logs and Attachments.

## Highlights 

* Full connection log and attachments support 
* The [{{ en.OBACK }} Service](/cloud/getting-started/devolutions-cloud-services/) is available for this data source 

{% snippet icon.shieldInfo %} 
All passwords are encrypted by default by {{ en.RDMMAC }}. You can specify a custom password to fully encrypt the content of the SQLite database. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.shieldWarning %} 
Password recovery is not possible, the data will be unrecoverable if you cannot authenticate. Please ensure you backup the password in a safe place. 
{% endsnippet %}
 
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
SQLite supports an unlimited number of simultaneous readers, but will only allow one writer at any instant in time. For this reason {{ en.RDMMAC }} does not support sharing an SQLite data source between several users by storing it on a network drive. If you want to share your data and work in a team environment with your colleagues, please use one of the [Advanced Data Sources](/rdm/mac/data-sources/data-sources-types/advanced-data-sources/). Please consult [SQLite.org](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html) for more information.

## Password management
