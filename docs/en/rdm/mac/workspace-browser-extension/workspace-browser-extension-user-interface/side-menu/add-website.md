The ***Add Website*** button is only available while in the [***Matching***](/rdm/mac/workspace-browser-extension/workspace-browser-extension-user-interface/side-menu/#matching-tab) tab, which is the tab selected when opening the extension. It opens a new tab in your browser that allows you to add a website entry in {{ en.RDMMAC }} through the {{ en.WBEX }}.

When {{ en.RDMMAC }} is used as the data source, the entry configuration is done in the ***General*** tab.
