The {{ en.WBEX }} user interface is slightly different in your browser depending on the Devolutions product used in conjunction with the extension. This topic will present the {{ en.WBEX }} user interface when used with {{ en.RDMMAC }}.

The main view, which is the one displayed when first opening the {{ en.WBEX }}, can be divided into three main sections:

1. The ***Top Menu*** gives you access to some {{ en.WBEX }} functionalities and settings.
1. The ***Side menu*** is directly linked to the central panel, as each tab changes what is displayed in the window depending on its function.
1. The ***Content Area*** is where information will be displayed and where you can interact with {{ en.WBEX }} functionalities corresponding to the different tabs.

### Top Menu

If you use multiple Devolutions products with the extension, you can switch between them using the ***Data Source Selector*** at the left of the ***Top Menu***. A drop-down list will appear with the other products you have previously paired with the {{ en.WBEX }}.

### Side menu and Content Area

Using the tabs of the ***Side menu***, you can access various {{ en.WBEX }} features.

Each tab will display a different view in the ***Content Area***. The tabs available when using the {{ en.WBEX }} with {{ en.RDMMAC }} are:

* the ***Matching*** tab, where you find available credentials for a specific website.
* the ***Password Generator*** tab, where you can create a strong and secure password for a new account.
* the ***About*** tab, where you will find links to useful tools and information about the {{ en.WBEX }}.

See [Side menu](/rdm/mac/workspace-browser-extension/workspace-browser-extension-user-interface/side-menu/) for more information on each of the tabs.
