The ***Account*** tab gives you access to settings for customizing your {{ en.RDM }} interface. At the top, information about the account connected to Remote Desktop Manager is displayed.  
![Account tab](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/rdm/mac/RDMMac2075.png)  

## Settings

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
Changes made under the ***Settings*** section are applied to your {{ en.RDM }} application. This means that even if you change account or data source, the settings will still be in effect.
{% endsnippet %}  

Under ***Settings***, you can choose the [theme](/rdm/mac/user-interface/customization/theme/) of your Remote Desktop Manager application between the ***Light*** theme and the ***Dark*** theme. You can also choose to mirror your system's theme.  

Next, you can also change the [style of the main header (top menu)](/rdm/mac/user-interface/ribbon/) of your Remote Desktop Manager application. Choose between a ***Ribbon*** view or a ***Classic*** view.

## User Interface Profile

{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %} 
Usage profile changes are applied to your account in the current data source. This means that if you change your usage profile in a {{ en.DHUB }} or {{ en.DVLS }} data source in Remote Desktop Manager, the change will also be made in the web interface of that data source, and vice versa.
{% endsnippet %}  

***Usage profiles*** allow users to have a tailored experience in Remote Desktop Manager and other Devolutions products based on their tasks and roles.  

* ***IT professional***: A comprehensive interface with full-fledged capabilities and all remote connection features.  
* ***Business user***: A streamlined interface for managing sensitive information, such as passwords.  

{% snippet icon.badgeHelp %} 
For a more detailed overview of the profiles, see [Usage profiles](/rdm/mac/user-interface/customization/usage-profiles/).
{% endsnippet %}  

The profile can also be selected during the Remote Desktop Manager Onboarding process. If none is chosen or if the user decides to choose one later, they will be assigned the ***Default*** profile, which can be changed in ***File – Preferences – User Interface – Usage profile*** or in the web interface.
