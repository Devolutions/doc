  title: Embedded Sessions

The Embedded display mode allows you to open multiple sessions as tabs within {{ en.RDM }}, similar to the tabs in your standard web browser. Embedded sessions are one of the 3 available display modes, the other 2 being ***External*** and ***Undocked***.

The embedded display mode allows you as well to split the dashboard to display multiple sessions at once. For more information please consult [Split View](/rdm/mac/user-interface/content-area/embedded-sessions/split-windows/).
