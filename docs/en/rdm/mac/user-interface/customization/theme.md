The theme of {{ en.RDMMAC }} can be changed to better suit your preferences. It modifies the color and shade of the user interface.

This ***Theme*** setting is available in ***File – Preferences – User Interface***. You can choose the ***Light*** theme or the ***Dark*** theme. You can also choose to mirror your system's theme if you prefer. The theme will be automatically applied once you click ***OK***.
