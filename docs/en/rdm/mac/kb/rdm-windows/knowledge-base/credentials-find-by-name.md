In {{ en.RDM }}, users can edit entries to retrieve credentials stored in a credential entry located in their user vault by using the ***Find by name (User Vault)*** option.

To do so, simply right-click on an entry requiring credentials, such as an RDP session, and select ***Properties***. 

In the ***General*** view, open the credentials dropdown menu, and choose ***Find by name (User Vault)***, then enter the name of the entry from which you wish to retrieve your credentials in the adjacent field.
