Use the ***File – Import*** option to import entries in {{ en.RDMMAC }}. You can import multiple entry types from a multitude of sources. We support native import formats from many popular tools on the market and in case we do not support the native format or the third party, we have wizards available to import from a CSV file.

The import feature is only active if the import [Permission](/rdm/mac/commands/administration/user-management/permissions/) has been enabled inside the user account.
