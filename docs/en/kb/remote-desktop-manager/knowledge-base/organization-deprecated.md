  title: Devolutions Organization is deprecated
---
The Devolutions Organization feature was deprecated in {{ en.RDM }} 2023.1.

The feature made it possible to send email notifications when temporary access requests were created and approved with an SQL Server data source. According to our data, this feature was not actively used.

Temporary access requests will still work as they previously did in {{ en.RDM }}. Email notifications are also still available with {{ en.DHUB }} and {{ en.DVLS }}.
