{% endsnippet %}

## Export

1. In the {{ en.RDM }} ***{{ en.NPANE }}***, select your data source.
1. Go to ***Administration - Export All {{ en.VLT }}s (.rdx)***.
1. Select the {{ en.VLT }}s from the prompted list and click ***OK***.
1. For a typical migration, you would check the options ***Include credentials, Include attachments and documents*** and ***Encrypt with master key***.  
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %}
By default the credentials are NOT included. It is critical to check the ***Include credentials*** option in order for the exported data to include the credentials.
{% endsnippet %}  
{% snippet icon.shieldWarning %}
Specifying a master key will encrypt the whole content of the ***.rdx*** file to protect its content. It is highly recommended as a backup measure, but the key is absolutely necessary for decryption. Preserve this as well in a separate storage device for safekeeping.
