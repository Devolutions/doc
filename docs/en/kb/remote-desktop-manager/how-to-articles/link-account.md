The ***Linked Account*** feature allows users to associate another account under the same user profile. This feature is particularly beneficial when a user needs to manage different accounts simultaneously. For instance, a user may have an account with the email address bob@windjammer.co and another account with the email address _bob@windjammer.co, which serves as an elevated or privileged account.

Both users need to be created before trying to link them together.
