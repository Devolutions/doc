{% snippet icon.shieldWarning %}
When creating and sending a dump file, it is crucial that you exercise caution and ensure that the steps are followed correctly. Deviating from these instructions and sending a full dump file without the guidance of a Devolutions support specialist may result in unintended outcomes, including exposure of all the sensitive and personal data it contains.

Please read and understand our [Security disclaimer for sending a dump file](/kb/remote-desktop-manager/troubleshooting-articles/hung-rdm-dump-file-creation/security-disclaimer-sending-dump-file/) before proceeding.

There are no guarantees that we can identify the issue, but following this procedure may guide our team towards identifying the root cause.

The following procedure makes use of a tool offered by Microsoft's Technet, namely the [Sysinternals Suite](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ca/sysinternals/downloads/). The tool that we need is ***Process Explorer***. It will monitor {{ en.RDM }} and allow the creation of a dump file.  

1. Download and install the [Sysinternals Suite](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ca/sysinternals/downloads/) utilities.
1. From the installation folder, start the ***procexp64.exe*** or ***procexp.exe*** application.
1. Launch {{ en.RDM }}.
1. Replicate the steps that trigger the issue in {{ en.RDM }}.
1. In the ***Process Explorer***, right-click the ***RemoteDesktopManager.exe*** process.
1. Select ***Create Dump â€“ Create Minidump***.
1. Save the ***RemoteDesktopManager.dmp*** file.
1. Contact our [support team](mailto:service@devolutions.net) in order for them to provide a secure link that can be used to send them this file.
