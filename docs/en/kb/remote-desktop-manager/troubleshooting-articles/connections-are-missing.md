title: Connections are missing
---
User's connection list is missing. This either mean that the Name column is missing or the ***{{ en.NPANE }}*** as a whole is missing.
## Solutions
### The ***{{ en.NPANE }}*** is visible but the list of connections is missing
Right-click where the Column name is supposed to be displayed and click on Column Chooser.
