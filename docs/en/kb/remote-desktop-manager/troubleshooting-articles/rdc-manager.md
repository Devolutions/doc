{{ en.RDM }} uses a Microsoft ActiveX to open RDP sessions in embedded mode. Sometimes, connection issues can be associated to this file. In fact, {{ en.RDM }} uses the same ActiveX that Microsoft is using in RDC Manager.  

## Solution
Download and install [RDC Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/rdcman) to see if you encounter the same issue using this application.
