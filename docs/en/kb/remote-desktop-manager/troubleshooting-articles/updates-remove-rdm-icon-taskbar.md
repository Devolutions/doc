title: Updates Remove Remote Desktop Manager Icon from Taskbar
---
The {{ en.RDM }} icon from the taskbar gets removed at every update.  

Since Windows 10, there’s no more API available to manage the icon in the taskbar. It’s Windows/Microsoft that is removing the icon from the taskbar.  

Because of this, it’s almost impossible for us to control/manage the icon of Remote Desktop Manager in the taskbar.  

Other applications encounter the same issue as well as we can see over the internet. We are keeping it under the radar and if a fix is possible, we will implement it.  

As of now, the workaround would be to download the ZIP file of Remote Desktop Manager and perform the upgrade by simply deploying the content of the ZIP file inside the installation folder of Remote Desktop Manager.
