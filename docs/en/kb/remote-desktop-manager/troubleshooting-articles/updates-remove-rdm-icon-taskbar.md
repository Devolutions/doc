  title: Updates remove the {{ en.RDM }} icon from the taskbar
---
The {{ en.RDM }} icon from the taskbar gets removed at every update.  

Since Windows 10, there is no more API available to manage the icon in the taskbar. It is Windows/Microsoft that is removing the icon from the taskbar. Because of this, it is almost impossible for us to control/manage the {{ en.RDM }} icon in the taskbar.  

Other applications encounter the same issue as well. We are keeping it under the radar and if a fix is possible, we will implement it.  

As of now, the workaround is to download the ZIP file of {{ en.RDM }} and perform the upgrade by simply deploying the content of the ZIP file inside the installation folder of {{ en.RDM }}.
