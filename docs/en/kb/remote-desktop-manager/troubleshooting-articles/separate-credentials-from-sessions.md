  title: Separate credentials from sessions
---
The ***Merge credential list with session*** option in {{ en.RDM }} version 2021.1.27 and higher was deprecated.
## Solution
The workaround is to create a credential folder at the root of your {{ en.VLT }} and move your credentials entries inside.  

If needed an [Advanced search](/rdm/windows/commands/view/panels/search/advanced/) can be done to locate the credentials entries.

If you are using the inherited feature, you will need to edit your folder structure accordingly.
