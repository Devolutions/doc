The Security Provider was implemented in older {{ en.DVLS }} versions. It was deprecated in {{ en.DVLS }} 2019.2.9.0. It is no longer considered as secure as mentioned in [Update on {{ en.DVLS }} Security Provider Deprecation](https://blog.devolutions.net/2020/02/update-on-devolutions-password-server-security-provider-deprecation).

The following procedure explains how to remove the Security Provider and implement the encryption at REST using the encryption keys.

1. Ensure no users are connected to the {{ en.DVLS }} data source or the {{ en.DVLS }} web interface. It is possible to verify and disconnect all users in ***Reports â€“ Connected User List*** on the {{ en.DVLS }} web interface.
1. Switch the {{ en.DVLS }} instance to offline with the ***Go Offline*** button on the {{ en.DVLSCONSOLE }}.  
![Go Offline](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/kb/KB8046.png)
1. If the scheduler is installed, please uninstall it from the {{ en.DVLSCONSOLE }} in ***Companions***. If a service account is configured to run the scheduler service, make sure you have the service account's password to reinstall it at the end of the procedure.

1. Back up the {{ en.DVLS }} web application folder or, if possible, take a screenshot of the virtual machine were {{ en.DVLS }} is hosted.
1. Make a full database backup.
1. In the ***Tools*** menu of the {{ en.DVLSCONSOLE }}, click on ***Remove Security Provider***.

![Confirmation message](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/kb/KB8048.png)  
![Removed successfully](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/kb/KB8049.png)
1. Switch the {{ en.DVLS }} instance to online mode using ***Go Online***.  
![Go Online](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/kb/KB8050.png)
1. Once completed, verify that the data is available: entries' configuration, passwords, etc. Verify the documents or attachments that exist in the database.  
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %}
If {{ en.DVLS }} is installed in a load balancing / high availability topology, only remove the Security Provider on one node. Then, refresh the other nodes to notice that the Security Provider has been removed.
{% endsnippet %}  

9. On success, switch the instance to offline mode, make another database backup and a screenshot of the virtual machine were {{ en.DVLS }} is hosted. If for any reason, any of the next steps fails, a backup will be available to get back at this step instead of starting over.
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %}
If the ***Activate Encryption at Rest*** button is not visible in ***Tools***, please jump to step 13.
{% endsnippet %}  

10. Go in ***Tools*** in the {{ en.DVLSCONSOLE }}, then click on ***Activate Encryption At Rest***. This step is to properly encrypt the data in the SQL database.

11. Once completed, export the Encryption Keys. Make sure to save that file and the password in a secure place to be able to build another {{ en.DVLS }} instance connected to the same SQL database. Without those encryption keys, it is impossible to access to the data.
{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %}
We recommend to not store the encryption keys file and its password in your {{ en.DVLS }} instance.
{% endsnippet %}

![Filename and File password](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/kb/KB8053.png)
1. Once completed, verify again if the entries, the documents, and the attachments are available.  
1. If the scheduler service has been uninstalled in step 3, install it back from the {{ en.DVLSCONSOLE }} in the ***Companions*** tab.  
![Install the scheduler](https://webdevolutions.azureedge.net/docs/en/kb/KB8084.png)
1. On success, one last database backup and virtual machine screenshot can be done.  
{% snippet icon.badgeInfo %}
If {{ en.DVLS }} is installed in a load balancing / high availability topology, refresh the {{ en.DVLSCONSOLE }} and import the encryption keys to ensure using the same on every node.
