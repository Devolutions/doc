The {{ en.VLT }}s management allows to create and manage {{ en.VLT }}s. To access the {{ en.VLT }}s management, navigate to ***Administration â€“ {{ en.VLT }}s***.  

The ***{{ en.VLT }}s*** allow users to [create entries](/server/web-interface/vault/entries/create-entries-manually/) and manage the content of the data source. They are containers that divide the data source into multiple compartments.  

We recommend using {{ en.VLT }}s for improved organization and security. {{ en.VLT }}s also help performance as they limit the amount of entries that load at once.
