## Settings  
### Database configuration

Enable database backup

	<tr>
		<td>
Backup database file path 
		</td>
		<td>
This is the path to the folder where the backup of the SQL database will be saved.<br>

We recommend the use of a shared network folder with proper permissions set on it to be able to save the backup file.  

Note: Since the backup command is running on the SQL Server and on the machine where {{ en.DVLS }} is hosted, this path must be accessible from both. We recommend configuring the database backup path using a UNC path.  

If a service account is set on the ***Scheduler Service***, the account needs the "write" permission on the destination folder.
