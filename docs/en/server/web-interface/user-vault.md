The ***{{ en.UVLT }}*** is a user centric ***{{ en.VLT }}*** used to store personal account information, credentials, and passwords. It allows each user to have their very own ***{{ en.UVLT }}***.  

The ***{{ en.UVLT }}*** also prevents users from using a non-secure tool to manage their personal passwords at work.
