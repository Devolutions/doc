You can request access to a public vault in {{ en.DVLS }}. Follow the steps below to complete a request.

1. Connect to the {{ en.DVLS }} that contains the vault you want access to.
1. In the vault selector drop-down menu, click ***More*** and then click on ***View All Vaults***.  

1. Select the vault you want to access, then click on ***Request Access***.  

1. Write a short message to the approver explaining why the access to this vault is needed.  
{% snippet icon.shieldInfo %}
The message is optional, but we recommend it as it allows the administrator or vault owner to make a more informed decision.
{% endsnippet %}

1. Click on ***Send Access Request***.

You now have to wait for the approver to respond to your request. If they approve your request, the vault will appear in the vault selector drop-down menu with the other vaults you already have access to.
