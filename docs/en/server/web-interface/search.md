The [***Search***](#search) feature helps you quickly find certain entries within your vault(s). The [***Advanced Search***](#advanced-search) is useful for more specific inquiries because it lets you add filters to the search.

The ***Search*** feature screen has a ***Recently viewed*** section that shows entries that were used recently. There is also a ***Clear Recent Entries*** button to clear those results.

Searching for a specific word, part of a word or multiple words will show all corresponding results. Disabling the ***All Vaults*** option will limit the search to the active vault.
