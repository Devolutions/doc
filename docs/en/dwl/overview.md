{{ en.DWL }} is a web browser password plugin used in conjunction with {{ en.RDM }}, {{ en.DVLS }}, and {{ en.HUB }}, which allows users to securely inject passwords into websites using credentials stored in their {{ en.VLT }}s.  

It gives system administrators full control over the management of passwords, without affecting the user's productivity.

{% snippet icon.shieldWarning %} 
Advanced users, other browser extensions, or even JavaScript injection can all result in the password being read from the password edit control, even if it displays dots instead of the password. Any use of an external browser must be carefully weighed against your security requirements.
