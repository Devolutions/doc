# Devolutions Docs

Devolutions's documentations build with 11ty.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 12.0.0

## Markdown

Since we are using 11ty to build our markdown files, we can add customs attributes and shortcodes.

### Variables

You can use variables that are listed in the folder [_data](https://github.com/Devolutions/doc/tree/master/docs/_data).

example
```markdown
{{ en.AGENT }}
## {{ en.AGENT }} Description
...
```
To use variables in the Front Matter add `eleventyComputed:`

example
```markdown
---
eleventyComputed:
  title: Batch Edit in {{ en.RDM }}

---
```

### Shortcodes

**YouTube Video**

To embed a YouTube video use the following shortcode, and use the video id as the parameter.

```markdown
{% youtube 'video_id' %}
```

**Snippet**

To create a new snippet, use the following shortcode, the icon is optional.
The content of the snippet is interpreted as markdown.

The list of the icons is available [here](https://github.com/Devolutions/doc/blob/master/docs/_data/icon.json).

Most Used Icons
- badgeCaution
- badgeHelp
- badgeInfo
- badgeNotice
- badgeWarning

```markdown
{% snippet %}
Here is the content of my snippet
{% endsnippet %}

{% snippet icon.badgeCaution %}
Here is the content of my snippet
{% endsnippet %}
```

**Code Language**

Here is the list of language supported: [Supported Languages â€” highlight.js 11.7.0 documentation](https://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported-languages.html)  

Use this markdown syntax with triple back ticks followed by the code language.
