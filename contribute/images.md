## Images

For security purposes, and since we use a cloud storage management tool to store the images for our documentation topics, you cannot add your images directly into a topic that you edit or create.  

It is possible to send us images. However, know that to ensure consistency throughout our documentation, our image standards are quite specific. This means that your image(s) will most likely not be added to our documentation, or at least will be edited by our team first, since they would not meet our particular standards.

### Image guidelines

Nevertheless, if you wish to send us images, here are some basic guidelines to follow regarding your screenshots:  
* Hide any personal and/or sensitive information: names, email/IP/physical addresses, credentials, serial/license numbers, locations, etc.
* Make sure that everything you want to show is clearly visible. It may help to resize your window to include more information in the screenshot.
* To ensure quality, use the best screen resolution you can and do not change the size of your image(s).
* Use the default theme of the website/application you are taking a screenshot of.
* Do not add markers (arrows, boxes, circles, etc.) to your image(s).

### Sending the image

To send us your image(s), [create an issue](https://github.com/Devolutions/doc/issues) in our repository on GitHub. Give it a meaningful title and leave an explanation about the image that indicates:

* what it represents.
* the reason you are sending it to us.
* the location where you would like to it added (if applicable).
* any other information you find useful.
