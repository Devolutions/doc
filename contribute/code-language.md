## How to include code in Markdown

To indicate individual code elements (words) within a line, enclose them with a single backtick.  

Here's an example of `code` style.  

For code blocks use triple back ticks followed by the code language.  

Example for PowerShell:  

````
```powershell
Insert PowerShell code
```
````

It would result in the following outcome:  

```powershell
Insert PowerShell code
```
