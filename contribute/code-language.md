## How to include code in Markdown

To indicate individual code elements (words) within a line, enclose them with a single backtick.  

Here's an example of `code` style.  

For code blocks, use triple backticks followed by the code language.  

Example for PowerShell code:  

````
```powershell
Insert PowerShell code
```
````

The result would be as follows:  

```powershell
Insert PowerShell code
```
