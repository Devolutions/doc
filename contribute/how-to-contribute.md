### Create a new topic

1. Go to the ***docs*** folder in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Devolutions/doc/tree/master/docs).
1. Open one of the three language folders:
    * To create an English topic, open the ***en*** folder.
    * To create a German topic, open the ***de*** folder.
    * To create a French topic, open the ***fr*** folder.

   All topics are located in those three language folders. Therefore, for security reasons, any modification outside of those folders will not be considered.

1. Follow the folder structure until you find the location where you think the new topic would fit best.

   The folder structure follows the tree view structure of the [documentation website pages](https://docs.devolutions.net/). It may help to look up the location in our online documentation first, then trace your steps in GitHub. Also consult [Devolutions Documentation and Knowledge Base](devolutions-documentation-knowledge-base.md) to help you determine where your topic should be located.

   We may change its location if we deem that it should be placed elsewhere.

1. Once you have found the desired location in GitHub, in the direct parent folder, click ***Add file***, then ***Create new file*** to write the topic in the GitHub web interface.
![!!Add file – Create new file](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/docs_common_contribute_create_new_file.png)

   For security reasons, the option to upload a file is disabled.

1. Name your file at the top in the path by following the instructions below. Note that even if it is based on the topic title, it is not the title but the file name (it will appear in the page URL).
   ![!!Name your file](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/docs_common_contribute_name_your_file.png)

    1. Decide on a meaningful topic title. For example, "Create an account for a website". The file name must always be in English, even if the topic content is not.
{type="a"}
        * If the topic you are creating is not in English, first translate the topic title to English for the purpose of the deciding the file name.
        * If the topic you are creating is the translation of an existing topic, keep the same English file name as the original English topic.
    1. Keep essential words (nouns and verbs) and discard the rest. For example, "Create account website".
    1. Make all letters lowercase and replace spaces with hyphens ("-"). For example, "create-account-website".
    1. Add the ".md" extension at the end of the file name. For example, "create-account-website.md".

1. Write your topic. At any time, you can click the ***Preview*** tab in GitHub to see what the topics will look like in the web page. Note that some features may not display correctly in this tab, but will be properly displayed in the final product.
   ![!!Edit and Preview tabs](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/docs_common_contribute_edit_preview_tabs.png)
